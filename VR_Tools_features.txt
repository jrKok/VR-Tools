VR Tools : A plugin for X Plane aimed at native VR
actually implemented (30 April 2018) :
+ One custom command to display FPS on demand in a separate small window
+ A custom command to filter the custom commands mapped to the trackpad or the stick of the standard controllers used by HTC vive or touch controllers
+ A text reader/streamer :
 - displays the whole content of a text file (.txt) in text format (UTF-8, standard on X Plane)
 - load any file with a file picker directly in VR
 - delete any lines from the display (not a physical delete, only delete from display)
 - the plugin can manually or autoreload the content of a text file, thus mimicking streaming if the text file is updated during the sesssion
 - ANSI to UTF-8 conversion
 - detect NAV, ADF or COM frequencies in a selected line, can be transferred into standy frequencies of matching radio NAV tools
 - intuitive resizing of display by dragging borders of the window displaying the file
 - adapt display to day/night status of flight

Currently under development :
 - a .ini file to preset options, file, directory

Future developments :
 - increase menu options to control display by plugin menu in X Plane 
 - increase mappable commands to enhance controls to navigate the text file in VR
 - possibility to edit the file directly in VR without physical keyboard
